## Summary

Jakarta faces a significant risk of flooding due to a combination of geographical, environmental, and human factors [(1)](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/8/2934) [(2)](https://eastasiaforum.org/2021/07/13/better-flood-management-can-save-jakarta/):

1.  **Geographical Location:** Jakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, which leads to the Java Sea. This coastal and low-lying geography makes it inherently vulnerable to flooding from the sea, especially during high tide events.

2.  **Ground Water Extraction:** Excessive groundwater extraction has caused Jakarta to sink at an alarming rate, with some areas experiencing subsidence rates of more than 10 cm per year. This subsidence exacerbates the risk of flooding, as the city becomes increasingly lower than sea level.

3.  **Urbanisation and Loss of Green Spaces:** Rapid urban development has led to the loss of green spaces and water-absorbent areas, increasing runoff and reducing the natural absorption of rainwater. This situation is worsened by the fact that many developments occur without proper consideration for their environmental impact, contributing to the city's vulnerability to floods.

4.  **Climate Change:** The effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and more intense rainfall events, heighten the risk of both coastal and pluvial flooding in Jakarta. These relate to many of the reasons mentioned here.

5.  **Inadequate Infrastructure:** Jakarta's drainage and flood management infrastructure are often inadequate to handle the volume of water from heavy rains and high tides, partly due to the rapid pace of urban development and challenges in governance and maintenance.

6.  **River Overflow:** The city is crossed by 13 rivers, and the overflow from these rivers during heavy rains is a significant cause of flooding in many parts of Jakarta.

These factors, create a complex challenge for flood risk management in Jakarta, especially due to the high degree of overlap and interconnectedness of these issues. Addressing these problems requires a nuanced approach that includes improving infrastructure (basic infrastructure, and climate change adaption infrastructure), regulating groundwater extraction, enhancing urban planning to forefront sustainability issues, and further action to mitigate the effects of climate change.

### Jakarta's Current Strategy

Jakarta's strategy for managing its significant flood risk has evolved to include both infrastructural developments and nature-based solutions (NbS), addressing the city's unique challenges such as extreme urbanization, land subsidence, and the impacts of climate change.

The [**Jakarta Coastal Defense Strategy (JCDS)**](https://projects.rvo.nl/programmes/nl-kvk-27378529-23583) and the subsequent [**National Capital Integrated Coastal Development Masterplan (NCICD)**](https://projects.rvo.nl/projects/nl-kvk-27378529-pvwb12003), also known as the "Giant Sea Wall" or "Great Garuda" project, stand out as major infrastructural components of Jakarta's flood management efforts. Initiated with Dutch collaboration, these projects are [aiming to protect the city](https://floodlist.com/asia/plans-reduce-jakarta-flooding) from sea-level rise and coastal flooding by constructing large sea walls and creating retention areas to manage excess water. This strategy is being complemented by efforts to regulate river flows and expand flood reservoirs, as well as the clearing of waterways to restore their capacity. However, the Giant Sea Wall has come under criticism with [Garschagen et al (2018)](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/8/2934) describing is as "\[cemeting\] rather than \[transforming\] the current risk management paradigm which gravitates around the goal of controlling flood symptoms, rather than addressing their largely anthropogenic root causes."

Despite the ambitious plans and potential benefits of these strategies, [Jakarta faces challenges](https://floodlist.com/asia/plans-reduce-jakarta-flooding) such as budgetary constraints, poor maintenance of existing infrastructure, and the need for significant resettlement to accommodate new projects. Additonally, the success of these initiatives requires overcoming bureaucratic and corruption-related hurdles that have historically impeded large-scale urban projects in Indonesia.

## Application

[Garschagen et al (2018)](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/8/2934) identify that Jakarta is not being held back by lack of will for change - quite the opposite. They describe that despite the scale of the planned projects (such as the Great Garuda project), solutions have been found to many, typical, issues including financing or technical barriers. Instead the main challenge is within governance and related to issues within "societal and political negotiation of conflicting visions and paradigms for risk reduction, and especially the burden-sharing of negative side-effects" (ibid, pp. 15).

Consequently, a move which may be highly beneficial for Jakarta is more transparent data sharing and discussion. The development of an online quasi dashboard forum.

> In Barcelona, [Decidim](https://decidim.org/) is a digital platform for citizen participation - it allows the urban realm to be discussed with participation at the forefront. Citizens are effectively invited to design and improve upon the participatory process; invited to contribute proposals that will be debated (which could translate into binding legislation, provided certain thresholds are met); and invited to monitor and assess both the process in its procedures as in its outcomes.

> In Singapore, [Virtual Singapore](https://www.geospatialworld.net/prime/case-study/national-mapping/virtual-singapore-building-a-3d-empowered-smart-nation/), a dynamic digital twin of the city-state, simulates the urban environment through integrates intricate details of the city along with real-time dynamic data, facilitating a range of urban planning and management tasks. It uses an extensive range of data sources including air quality, temperature, and noise. It allows different scenarios to be tested; for emergency preparedness, urban planning considerations, development collaboration, environmental impacts, among others. Whilst it is aimed at government and development organisations, it will be made accesible to the public in the future.

Jakarta could utilise these case studies. Through the use of rain gauges, historic weather data, water level sensors, satellite imagery and population data, Jakarta could build an online dashboard utilising the most up-to-date information.

Esri Indonesia's ESSC has developed a [flood map portal](https://esriindonesia.co.id/news/esscs-gis-powered-jakarta-flood-map-portal), however it does not go far enough and could benefit from more dynamic satellite and population data.

Satellite imagery could be attained from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, due to their ability to provide global coverage to high spatial and temporal resolutions. Sentinel-1 is equipped with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and so can penetrate clouds and provide imagery during day and night, making it ideal for rapid mapping of flood events and supporting early warning systems. Sentinel-2 complements this with high-resolution optical imaging, useful for monitoring inundation events and assessing damage post-crisis, although its effectiveness can be hampered by cloud cover during rainfall events.

Population data can be synthesised, along with 'on the ground' sensors to assess, both in real-time and through forecasting, locations at the greatest risk, taking into account impacted population size, likely infrastructural damage, and scale of impact.

Through making this accessible to citizens, they are able to prepare in the event of an emergency situation, but are also able to reconcile their own experiences of flooding with an quantifiable collective understanding of the risks it poses. This could allow more informed discussions where citizens and the government engage openly.

-   **Flood Mapping and Monitoring:** SAR data allows for the real-time mapping of flood extents, even under cloud cover, which is crucial for timely evacuation and response.
-   **Risk Assessment:** Combining SAR data with DEMs and population data helps identify flood-prone areas, critical for planning and implementing flood defenses.
-   **Infrastructure Planning:** Insights from remotely sensed data support the design and placement of flood mitigation infrastructure, like dams and improved drainage systems.
-   **Disaster Preparedness and Response:** The data enhances the efficiency of disaster response efforts by identifying affected areas and prioritizing rescue and relief operations.

**Link to Global Goals**\
Jakarta's efforts to manage flooding through remotely sensed data contribute to the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), particularly:

-   **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities):** By enhancing urban resilience against flooding.
-   **SDG 13 (Climate Action):** Contributing to disaster risk reduction in the face of climate change.

## Reflection

I particularly enjoyed this week as it has lent itself a lot to what I studied for my BSc - urban planning. The case of Jakarta is severe - it is one of the largest megacities in the world and is facing an immense crisis regarding flooding. Its sinking rate of 10cm a year is quite phenomenal - that is one meter every 10 years (so, in theory, has sunk over 2m over the course of my life, which is an astounding thought). \[Edit from week 9: SAR could be implemented in this regard to the proposed dashboard for its ability to detect elevations and understand where the city is sinking at the most rapid rates\].

These solutions are not easy - whilst it is very easy to say that they 'simply need to develop a dashbaord', the issue goes beyond that. Responses to urban issues are often complex, with many competing interests and desires. Further, the inevitable issue of project financing, especially in a country where corruption is an issue and access to capital, whilst not critically lacking, leaves more to be desired for an optimal response. When looking at policy documents and urban issues, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of policy documentation (which is often bulky, not completely up-to-date, and hard to naviagate) and resident desires and needs.

Additionally, there can often be issues with citizen participation in planning issues. This is especially the case in the UK (as in many other countries), a context I am accutely aware of from experience. Local elections typically achieve 30% turnout rates, and local planning issues typically can often receive far less attention than that. My initial assumption was that RS technology would be able to more effectively engage people through its ability to provide 'objective' data at a global level. However in all data issues - the insights are highly dependent on the individual that produces that insight (through bias, selective use of data, etc.), but also due the relative complexity of RS technology, it may scare many people. However, a recent Guardian article, [*Britons go map-crazy, with geographical games and books becoming bestsellers*](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/oct/31/metro-memory-and-tim-marshall-put-cartography-back-on-the-map), demonstrates that we do have an interest in mapping and that maps are a great way to engage the public. By also adopting RS insights into maps, governments may be able to more effectively engage citizens. Of course this is reliant on governmental bodies providing good governance and leadership.
