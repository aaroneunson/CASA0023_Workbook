## Summary

### SAR Fundamentals

[**SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar):**]{.underline}

An active sensor technology that emits electromagnetic signals to capture surface texture data, capable of seeing through weather and clouds. SAR sensors can be mounted on various platforms and utilize different wavelengths for diverse applications. It actively emits and then receives electromagnetic waves, distinguishing it from passive sensors that rely on available energy, such as the sun's reflection.

[**Polarization:**]{.underline}

Refers to the orientation of the electromagnetic wave's plane, critical in determining how different surfaces interact with SAR signals. Polarisations include single (horizontal or vertical), dual, and various combinations (HH, VV, VH, HV), influencing how rough surfaces, vegetation, or man-made structures are detected.

[**Amplitude and Phase:**]{.underline}

SAR signals contain amplitude (backscatter) information related to surface properties and phase data indicating the wave's cycle position upon return. This information is crucial for understanding surface roughness, volume, and permittivity.

### Practical Change Detection with SAR

[**InSAR and DInSAR:**]{.underline}

Techniques leveraging SAR images to detect surface topography and motion. Interferometry uses phase shifts to map ground movement, while Differential Interferometry (DInSAR) isolates movement by removing topographic effects.

[**SAR Data Processing:**]{.underline}

Involves transforming complex data (I and Q components) into a form suitable for analysis or visualization, presented in power, amplitude, or dB scale, each serving different purposes from statistical analysis to visual representation.

[**Change Detection Methods:**]{.underline}

Traditional methods like image subtraction are less effective due to SAR statistics. Ratio and log ratio techniques, improved ratio methods, and statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) are employed to better handle SAR data's unique properties.

[**Image Fusion:**]{.underline}

Combines SAR with optical data to enhance analysis, utilizing techniques like Principal Component Analysis and Object-Based Image Analysis for more accurate change detection and classification.

[**Applications and Challenges:**]{.underline}

SAR's ability to penetrate clouds and capture data under any weather conditions makes it invaluable for monitoring changes in the Earth's surface. However, interpreting SAR images, especially in urban areas, can be complex due to signal scattering phenomena like multiple bouncing and shadowing.

### Key Takeaways

-   SAR technology offers a powerful tool for Earth observation, capable of providing critical data on surface characteristics and changes over time, unaffected by weather conditions.

-   Its applications range from environmental monitoring to urban planning, leveraging various data processing and change detection techniques to interpret the complex signals captured by SAR sensors.

-   Despite its advantages, the effective use of SAR data requires careful consideration of sensor characteristics, data processing methods, and the specific goals of the analysis to overcome inherent challenges in interpretation and application.

## Application

### Rice Crop Monitoring

In Japan, a [study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/14/3254) leveraged C-band microwave images from Sentinel-1 satellites to monitor rice crop growth. The research aimed to understand how microwave backscatter behavior is influenced by decreases in panicle water content during ripening, which affects C-band backscatter. The findings demonstrated that Sentinel-1 images with shallow incidence angles and high revisit capabilities hold significant potential for estimating panicle water content, thereby providing a method to estimate the proper harvesting time based on grain filling conditions​​.

### **Wetland Monitoring**

A [comprehensive meta-analysis](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/14/2190) revealed SAR's capability in wetland monitoring, emphasising its unique potential for rapid and accurate mapping of wetland extent and type. This study reviewed 172 papers, and highlighted an upward trend in the use of SAR data for wetland research, with attention to the benefits of integrating multi-sensor data and the advantages of using multi-frequency and multi-polarised SAR data for higher classification accuracy.

![Number of studies for wetland mapping, change detection, water level monitoring, inundation mapping (water extraction), biomass and soil moisture application are shown (Adeli et al, 2020)](/Week9/remotesensing-12-02190-g012.png)

The study also identified challenges in applying SAR for wetland monitoring, such as the backscattering similarity among different wetland classes and the selection of appropriate SAR specifications based on wetland type. They suggest that the issue of backscattering similarity is best addressed through the use of supervised machine learning techniques (such as SVM, MLC, or Object-Based Random Forests).

> *"Changes in wetlands alter the surface being illuminated by the SAR signal and consequently change the image intensity or backscattering mechanism. The final outcome of intensity based change detection technique is calculated by differencing before and after phenomena image pixels. As mentioned, a change in the backscattering mechanism can be considered as an indicator of change in the surface type. As a case in point, when a wet soil turns into an open water body the backscattering mechanism changes from surface scattering to specular scattering. If the wetland surface is more complex, polarimetric features can be used as an input to object-based classification."*

## Reflection

What struck me this week is the ability of SAR to detect micro changes. Due to the properties of the waves being used (very small wavelengths), through implementing change detection (looking at one period in time compared to another), it is possible to detect cm changes in the elevation of the land.

I also find it quite jarring to move between SAR (for example) and multispectral waves (e.g. as collected by Landsat) - it would appear there are slightly different techniques involved. This is obvious though given they are different techniques. I have focussed on multispectral data for most of the module and have built a relative comfort to it, and so to then move to a discussion on SAR was quite interesting.

The rice crop monitoring case study is quite interesting, I did not delve into too deeply this week (purely through lack of time), but it is something I will explore further. I am planning to conduct my dissertation on mapping the wine industry of the UK, wherein identifying nuanced characteristics, which do not seem possible given the immense distances between the sensor and sensed object.

SAR strikes me as a very powerful sensor and indeed its ability to be operational at night as well as during the day (largely, unlike other sensors).
