# Intro to Google Earth Engine 

## Summary

### The Setup of GEE

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a geospatial processing service that allows for analysis at a large scale, leveraging massive datasets for planetary-scale analysis quickly. It operates by storing data on servers and executing user-written code on this data.

[**GEE Terminology:**]{.underline}

-   **Image:** Represents raster data and contains bands.

-   **Feature:** Represents vector data and contains geometry and attributes.

-   **ImageCollection:** A stack of images.

-   **FeatureCollection:** A collection of multiple polygons or vector data.

GEE uses JavaScript for coding, introducing specific syntax for variables and objects.

**Client vs. Server Side:** Code runs either in the browser (client-side) or on the server where data is stored. Objects prefixed with ee are server-side and considered "proxy objects."

**Scale and Projections:**

Scale refers to the resolution of images and is determined by the output in GEE, with automatic resampling as needed.

Projections are managed automatically by GEE, typically converting data into the Mercator projection for display.

### GEE in Action

**Building Blocks of GEE:** Objects can be vectors, rasters, features, strings, or numbers, each belonging to a specific class with unique GEE functions.

**Image Collections:** These are managed by filtering based on dates and regions to handle vast amounts of raster data.

**Geometries and Features:** Geometries are points, lines, or polygons without attributes, whereas features include attributes.

**Common GEE Processes:** Include geometry operations, joins, zonal statistics, filtering, and various machine learning methods.

**Reducing Images:** This involves summarizing image collections to specific values per pixel or region, such as calculating median values or average reflectance within a study area.

**Regression Analysis:** GEE supports linear regression over time to analyze changes in pixel values, utilizing a least squares approach and potentially multiple dependent variables.

**Joins:** Similar to database joins, allowing for the combination of image or feature collections based on specific criteria.

## Application

\
The introduction of Google Earth Engine has transformed the ways in which geospatial data is and can be analysed and applied. Due to its easy access to data (with over [50Pb of data in its catalogue](https://www.earthblox.io/blog/google-earth-engine-for-commercial-use-what-the-new-access-means-for-your-impact-business)!), processing capabilities, as well as its commercial accessibility, GGE has significant applications in environmental and climate change science, urban planning, agriculture, and disaster management, among many other uses.

In [2022, Google made it possible](https://blog.google/products/earth/introducing-earth-engine-for-governments-and-businesses/) to buy commercial licenses for the use of the platform, before this it was restricted (formally) for use in research, education, or not-for-profit activities.

### **Environmental Monitoring and Conservation**

One of the most significant applications of GEE is in environmental monitoring and conservation. Because of the platform's ability to handle massive datasets and perform planetary-scale analyses has been pivotal in tracking deforestation and forest fires, mapping biodiversity, and monitoring water resources. A study by [Hansen et al. (2013)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1244693) utilised GEE to map global forest cover and loss, providing insights into deforestation trends that inform conservation policies. They produced high-resolution global maps of 21st-century forest cover change. The study used GEE's ability to handle large-scale image collections and its efficient processing capabilities (which run on powerful remote servers) to analyse satellite imagery over time, illustrating the platform's power in environmental governance and policy-making. This ability to more easily understand, map, and quantify the world.

### **Climate Change and Carbon Sequestration Studies**

GEE has also been instrumental in climate change research, particularly in assessing carbon stocks and fluxes. The platform's ability to process and analyze vast amounts of raster data enables researchers to estimate carbon sequestration and emission levels across large areas. For example, Gorelick et al. (2017) highlighted the use of GEE in quantifying changes in forest carbon stocks, employing the platform's image collection and reduction capabilities to assess temporal changes in biomass. Such studies are crucial for understanding the carbon cycle and informing international climate agreements like the Paris Agreement.

### **Agricultural Practices and Sustainability**

Some companies, such as [Regrow](https://www.regrow.ag/case-studies), are using GEE to report and verify regenerative and sustainable agricultural techniques. Through GEE's analysis of historical and satellite imagery, Regrow is able to generate detailed data on farmland, enhancing the ability to monitor and improve sustainable practices on a large scale.

Regrow has collaborated with General Mills to track the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices across 175 million acres of agricultural land, globally. This effort involves using remote sensing technology and modeling (employing GEE) to monitor and verify regenerative techniques. The partnership is aiming to enhance resilience in General Mills' supply chain by making well-informed decisions about investing in regenerative programs, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 (although, in my personal view, this 30% target does not seem particularly revolutionary or impressive; the [UK government](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-recommits-uk-to-net-zero-by-2050-and-pledges-a-fairer-path-to-achieving-target-to-ease-the-financial-burden-on-british-families) has set its target at 68%, though the baseline level for each may vary).

Regrow and General Mills utilised the [Operational Tillage Information System (OpTIS)](https://www.ctic.org/OpTIS_Information) and [DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC)](https://www.ipbes.net/policy-support/tools-instruments/dndc-denitrification-decomposition) models for their project. OpTIS leverages satellite imagery to monitor and verify regenerative agriculture techniques, including tillage reduction and cover-crop adoption. The data from OpTIS feeds into the DNDC model, which simulates nutrient cycling in soil to predict crop growth, soil temperature and moisture, carbon dynamics, nitrogen leaching, and trace gases emissions and thus estimate net changes in greenhouse gas emissions.

## Reflection

Google Earth Engine certainly makes using RS data easier to manage. Its speed is incomparable with SNAP - where SNAP is walking, GEE is whizzing around the planet at the speed of the satellites themselves it would seem!

Whilst GEE is largely easy to use, it does come with the caveat of learning another coding language. As it is based on JavaScript, however, this does not seem too bad and shares many similarities with other languages I have learned, also the actual amount of JavaScript knowledge that is required is relatively little.

What has really surprised me is the immense uptake of GEE use within publications - annoyingly I can't seem to find the exact time-series plot I seem to remember us seeing in the lecture (of GEE use in RS publications compared with other languages uses), but the one I have shown for this week's entry still demonstrates the point - it has received exponentially increasing uptake, which is only likely to increase as more people become familiar with it.

It also surprised me that GEE only became available for commercial use in 2022 - given its immense capabilities, it seems (from a profit point of view) crazy for Google not to be licensing out the software's use. Although, I would assume perhaps Google was anxious of too significant interest that its servers (renown for their speed, compared to local computational capacity) would become overwhelmed.

On the note of profitability, whilst its uptake is massively impressive, it does raise concerns (at least in my mind) of monopolisation - if Google come to dominate the RS space and industry there are no doubt consequences of this. They have demonstrated themselves to deliver high-quality and have an exceptionally well regarded reputation. However, [Carr and Hesse (2020)](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/2519) demonstrated the implications of Alphabet Inc.'s (Google's parent company) involvement in a 'smart city' development in Toronto, Canada. They behaves in a hegemonic, monopolisitc way, disregarding local issues and complaints. Whilst that was within the realm of urban planning and urban development, it is still concerning.
