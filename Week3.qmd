# Corrections and Enahancements 

## Summary

### Pre-processing

**Pre-processing Requirements:** Remote sensing imagery may have errors due to factors like sensor issues, atmospheric conditions (such as clouds, rain, ash, etc), terrain, among others. These can be adjusted for.

**Scan Lines Issue:** An example of a sensor issue is the failure of the scan line corrector on Landsat 7, leading to gaps in imagery that necessitated development of gap-filling methods.

**Regression:** This concept is important for understanding how to model and predict values in remote sensing data. $yi=β0+β1xi+ϵi$

### Corrections

**Geometric Correction:** Corrects for image distortions due to view angle, topography, wind, and Earth's rotation using Ground Control Points (GCPs) and geometric transformation coefficients.

**Atmospheric Correction:** Essential for removing atmospheric effects that can alter image data, with methods ranging from simple dark object subtraction to complex radiative transfer models.

**Orthorectification Correction:** Refines georectification by removing distortions to ensure each pixel is represented as if viewed directly from above.

**Radiometric Calibration:** Transforms sensor-captured image brightness into meaningful spectral radiance measurements.

### Joining Data Sets

**Joining Data Sets (Mosaicking):** Techniques to merge multiple images seamlessly, often requiring adjustments to ensure consistency across the combined imagery.

### Image Enhancement

**Basic Enhancements:** improves the visual quality and interpretability of imagery

-   *Contrast enhancement*
-   [*Band ratio*](https://medium.com/regen-network/remote-sensing-indices-389153e3d947) Examples include NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index), SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index).

$$NDVI = \frac{NIR-Red}{NIR+Red}$$

$$NDWI = \frac{NIR-SWIR}{NIR+SWIR}$$

$$SAVI = \frac{NIR-Red}{NIR+Red+L}×(1+L)$$

> $L$ = value is adjusted based on the amount of vegetation; $L$=0.5 is the default value and works well in most situations. With $L$=0, NDVI=SAVI.

-   *Filtering*
-   *Edge enhancement*

**Advanced Enhancements:** further refines and enhances imagery for specific applications.

-   *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*
-   *Texture analysis*
-   *Image fusion* (e.g. pan sharpening)

**Key Considerations** The process involves correcting imagery for various errors before using it for analysis or interpretation.

Enhancements and corrections aim to improve image quality and consistency, facilitating better comparison and analysis across different images or time periods.

The application of these processes needs to be tailored to the specific needs and contexts of the imagery use, particularly in complex environments like urban areas.

Advanced techniques can add value to the imagery but also introduce complexity. It's essential to weigh the benefits against the potential complications or misinterpretations that may arise.

## Application

[**1. Loading Tiles**]{.underline}

In the below I have downloaded two satellite image collections from [USGS](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). They pertain to an area of Northern France, part of the English Channel, and South-East England.

> Here we can see the different band values (the 'layers' of the images, reflecting the levels of reflectance of that correlating wavelength) for the individual tiles

[**2. Merge Tiles**]{.underline}

> Here we can see the different band values for the merged tiles together

[**3.1 Enhancements: Ratio**]{.underline}

![Ratio Enhancement - NVDI](/Week3Content/ndvi_merged.png)

> Values are calculated using the NDVI formula above. Band 4 is Near-Infrared, while Band 5 is Red

![Ratio Enhancement - NVDI Greater Than 0.2; Merged Tile](/Week3Content/ndvi_greater_0.2_mergedtile.png)

> Here I have pulled out the values where the NDVI is greater than 0.2 (typically regarded as a good threshold level for healthy vegetation). Values less than 0.2 are simply displayed as white. We can see the difference between this and the first image generated for NDVI; especially when looking at water - no water is highlighted (due to not reflecting enough of those bands), consequently we are left with an image which describes the spatial arrangement of healthy vegetation.

[**Clipping the Merged Tile to a Study Area**]{.underline}

![Sample Area; clipped from merged tile](/Week3Content/clip_merged_area_to_study_area.png)

[**3.2 Enhancements: Texture**]{.underline}

![Texture Enhancement - Sample Area](/Week3Content/texture_enhancement.png)

> Here a texture enhancement has been performed on the study area. Higher values (closer to 1) from a texture analysis suggest that the area is more homogeneous (less contrast in the pixel values and a consequential smoother texture). This thus indicates homogeneous areas like open water, fields, or smooth and barren land, depending on the context of the image and other geographic data. The green areas have higher values, which seems appropriate; they largely reflect rural France which is comprised greatly of open fields.

[**3.2 Enhancements: Fusion**]{.underline}

![PCA Enhancement - Sample Area](/Week3Content/raster_texture_enhancement.png)

> The fusion performed here has stacked the raster layers, utilising the clipped image (the clipped study area) and the texture enhancement, on top of each other to create a multi-layer raster stack or a multi-band raster object. By comparing the homogeneity layer with the spectral layers, we can identify areas where the spectral data alone may not have been as informative. For example, if a green area in the homogeneity layer corresponds with a unique feature in one of the spectral layers, this could indicate a region of interest for further investigation.

[**3.3 Enhancements: PCA**]{.underline}

![PCA Enhancement - Sample Area](/Week3Content/pca_enhancement.png)

> PCA transforms the original correlated variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables, called principal components (PCs), which are ordered so that the first few retain most of the variation present in the original dataset. Essentially it can be used to reduce the number of dimensions of a dataset. The first image is the one of most interest here - that new dimension effectively helps to explain most of the variance amongst other dimensions.

## Reflection

After discussing with a few coursemates, many people seemed to struggle with the content of this week, however, I must say that I quite enjoyed it. The process of correcting an image feels somewhat linear and I regret not producing a flow chart to really demonstrate its relative simplicity. 

As with the first week - it is quite fun and satisfying to take quite illegible images and turn it into something actionable and insightful. The sample area that I looked at this week (when I clipped my merged tile to a smaller bounding area) contains Calais, France and its surrounding landscape. It is evident from the analysis I have conducted that it is predominantly countryside uses - high NDVI values and an abundance of high values within the texture enhancement. However, the texture analysis also revealed an 'archipelago in the sea of green' of moderately textured areas. From looking at OS maps and through my own understanding I would assume that these represent very sparse human settlements (towns and villages as well as agricultural built-up uses). 

Ratio seems like an exceptionally easy to use and understand concept in particular (unless I have completely understoon it!). There seem to be a vast array of indices (and their formulae) available and easily searchable online. It primarily a matter of taking the band values for a pixel (dependent on the index you are attempting to calculate) and applying the function to the image. 

This is a highly relevant topic and something I will likely return to in my own time to play with. When it comes to the matter of professional use, however, it does slightly concern me. Whilst I feel I am able to draw basic insights from manipulated imagery, identifying more nuanced phenomena seems much harder. Although I am sure that this is mostly a matter of exposure and with enough use, I will grow familar with what to look out for, what is and isn't typical, etc.
