# Corrections and Enahancements

## Summary

### Pre-processing

**Pre-processing Requirements:** Remote sensing imagery may have errors due to factors like sensor issues, atmospheric conditions (such as clouds, rain, ash, etc), terrain, among others. These can be adjusted for.

**Scan Lines Issue:** An example of a sensor issue is the failure of the scan line corrector on Landsat 7, leading to gaps in imagery that necessitated development of gap-filling methods.

**Regression:** This concept is important for understanding how to model and predict values in remote sensing data. $yi=β0+β1xi+ϵi$

### Corrections

**Geometric Correction:** Corrects for image distortions due to view angle, topography, wind, and Earth's rotation using Ground Control Points (GCPs) and geometric transformation coefficients.

**Atmospheric Correction:** Essential for removing atmospheric effects that can alter image data, with methods ranging from simple dark object subtraction to complex radiative transfer models.

**Orthorectification Correction:** Refines georectification by removing distortions to ensure each pixel is represented as if viewed directly from above.

**Radiometric Calibration:** Transforms sensor-captured image brightness into meaningful spectral radiance measurements.

### Joining Data Sets

**Joining Data Sets (Mosaicking):** Techniques to merge multiple images seamlessly, often requiring adjustments to ensure consistency across the combined imagery.

### Image Enhancement

**Basic Enhancements:** improves the visual quality and interpretability of imagery

-   *Contrast enhancement*
-   [*Band ratio*](https://medium.com/regen-network/remote-sensing-indices-389153e3d947) Examples include NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index), SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index).

$$NDVI = \frac{NIR-Red}{NIR+Red}$$

$$NDWI = \frac{NIR-SWIR}{NIR+SWIR}$$

$$SAVI = \frac{NIR-Red}{NIR+Red+L}×(1+L)$$

> $L$ = value is adjusted based on the amount of vegetation; $L$=0.5 is the default value and works well in most situations. With $L$=0, NDVI=SAVI.

-   *Filtering*
-   *Edge enhancement*

**Advanced Enhancements:** further refines and enhances imagery for specific applications.

-   *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*
-   *Texture analysis*
-   *Image fusion:* (e.g. pan sharpening)

**Key Considerations** The process involves correcting imagery for various errors before using it for analysis or interpretation.

Enhancements and corrections aim to improve image quality and consistency, facilitating better comparison and analysis across different images or time periods.

The application of these processes needs to be tailored to the specific needs and contexts of the imagery use, particularly in complex environments like urban areas.

Advanced techniques can add value to the imagery but also introduce complexity. It's essential to weigh the benefits against the potential complications or misinterpretations that may arise.
